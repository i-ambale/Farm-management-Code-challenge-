# 🌾 Farm Harvest Management

This is a beginner-friendly Python project designed for practicing basic arithmetic operations and variable assignment using a real-world scenario: farm harvest management.

## 📚 Project Description

In this code challenge, we help a farmer calculate:
- The total harvest from two fields: wheat and potatoes.
- The overall expenses incurred.
- The profit made in the season.

This project is written in a Jupyter Notebook and uses basic Python programming principles, making it ideal for beginners.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Assign numerical values to variables.
- Perform basic arithmetic operations.
- Use the `print()` function to display results clearly.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
